# Guitar Scales and Pentatonics Fretboard Viewer

This repository contains the code for an app that allows you to visualize scales and pentatonics on a guitar fretboard. It's a handy tool for musicians, guitar enthusiasts, and learners to explore scales and their corresponding pentatonic patterns interactively.

## Tech Stack

This app is built using modern web technologies:
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and developer productivity
- **Next.js**: Utilized for its static site generation (SSG) capabilities
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organizes the codebase for scalability and maintainability

The app is available at https://pentafret.com

## Features

### Pages

#### Notes Page (/)
- The home page displays all the notes on the guitar fretboard
- Shows a complete 15-fret, 6-string guitar fretboard with standard tuning

#### Scales Page (/scales/[scaleType]/[rootNote]/[tonality])
At the top of the scale page, you'll find controls to customize your view:
1. **Root Note**: Select the root note of the scale. Options include all 12 notes (e.g., A, B, C#, etc.)
2. **Scale Type**: Choose between:
   - Full scale
   - Pentatonic scale
   - Blues scale
3. **Tonality**: Select between Major or Minor

Below the controls, the fretboard displays the notes of the selected scale.

#### CAGED Page (/caged/[view]/[tonality])
The CAGED page offers two views:
- **Chords**: Displays chord forms for C, A, G, E, and D
- **Arpeggios**: Shows arpeggio patterns for each form

And two tonalities:
- **Major**: Shows major chord forms and arpeggio patterns
- **Minor**: Shows minor chord forms and arpeggio patterns

Each view showcases five sections focusing on a specific fretboard section to illustrate chord or arpeggio shapes. Users can switch between views and tonalities using the controls at the top of the page.

#### CAGED Templates Page (/caged/[view]/[tonality]/[chord])
The CAGED Templates page allows users to:
- Select a specific CAGED chord to view its templates in the selected tonality
- View a series of 6 fretboards showing chord progressions
- See both chord and arpeggio variations

Examples:
- **CAGED Template C Major Chords**:
  - Open C chord
  - C ("A form" barre chord)
  - C ("G form" barre chord)
  - C ("E form" barre chord)
  - C ("D form" barre chord)
  - C ("C form" barre chord)

- **CAGED Template C Major Arpeggios**:
  - C arpeggio ("C form")
  - C arpeggio ("A form")
  - C arpeggio ("G form")
  - C arpeggio ("E form")
  - C arpeggio ("D form")
  - C arpeggio ("C form")

The same pattern applies to minor tonality, showing the appropriate minor chord and arpeggio forms.

#### Triads Page (/triads/[index]/[rootNote])
The Triads page offers:
- Visualization of triads within the context of a major scale
- Selection of the root note of the major scale
- Selection of one of the seven triads within the scale
- Display of five scale patterns with the selected triad highlighted in each pattern

#### Songs Page (/songs)
The songs page provides:
- A curated list of songs organized by guitar theory topics
- Expandable/collapsible sections for each topic
- Ability to track learning progress by checking off learned songs

### Fretboard Display
- The app displays a guitar fretboard with 15 frets and 6 strings (plus open notes on the notes and scales pages)
- Each note in the scale is highlighted with a distinct color and labeled with the note name
- The root note is highlighted in a different color
- For blues scales, a "blue note" is highlighted in a distinct color

### Scale Information
- The page title displays the full name of the scale (e.g., "E Minor Pentatonic Scale")
- For pentatonic scales, a subtitle shows a clickable link to the relative pentatonic scale
- For full scales, a subtitle shows a clickable link to the relative full scale
- For blues scales, the subtitle indicates that it contains the same notes as the pentatonic scale plus a blue note

### Pentatonic Patterns
For the following scale types, the app displays 5 standard patterns:
- **Pentatonic scales**: Each pattern is shown on a dedicated fretboard. Patterns progress from first to fifth. For minor pentatonic scales, the first pattern starts from the root note. For major pentatonic scales, the first pattern starts from the next note of the pentatonic scale.
- **Full scales**: Similar to pentatonic patterns, 5 standard patterns are displayed for both major and minor full scales, each shown on a dedicated fretboard and progressively covering different positions on the neck.
- **Blues scales**: Follow the same pattern structure as pentatonic scales with the addition of the blue note highlighted in each pattern.

### URL Patterns
- The app supports dynamic URL patterns for easy sharing and navigation:
  - `/scales/[scaleType]/[rootNote]/[tonality]`
  - Example: `/scales/pentatonic/e/minor` shows the E minor pentatonic scale
  - `/caged/[view]/[tonality]` where view is either `chords` or `arpeggios` and tonality is either `major` or `minor`
  - `/caged/[view]/[tonality]/[chord]` for CAGED templates
  - `/triads/[index]/[rootNote]` where index is one of the seven triads and rootNote is the root of the major scale
  - `/songs` for accessing the songs library
